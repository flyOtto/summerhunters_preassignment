Pre-assignment for HoxHunt Data Summer Hunters 2020

I learned to use Python DataFrame together with a new module called urllib. I also used an scientific article covering phissing URL detection methods for basis of my code. 

This project has been really intruiging and something I would love to forward on my freetime.
